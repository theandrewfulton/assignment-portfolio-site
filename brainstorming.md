# Brainstorming and Notes


## Notes


Project section can be blank, but if you're proud of something, put it in there!

github and linkedin are mandatory links, others are optional

link to resume or resume mockup

navbar or card with image, caption and text are examples with components

use flexbox or grid

need evidence of source control

work history doesn't have to be IT related

at least 4 components across the assignment

blog posts need to be on the website

teck stack including where you deployed it to.

google slides are very good, powerpoint is fine. Slide deck needs to be a pdf

SRI requires sha-512

show wireframes and sitemap to educator before going too far.


## Brainstorming


### Responsive Design


mobile: burger menu

tablet: nav on left dropdown

desktop: nav along top


### Site Components

Copyright in footer

Favicon


### Pages

#### Pages to include:

- Home

- About/skills?

- Blog

- Contact

- Projects?

Should About/Skills be on Home?

#### index.html

something like Hi I'm Andrew (Hi I'm jack) - Junior Full Stack Developer - Contact me!? This could also link to Projects page if implemented

See [https://jacekjeznach.com/](https://jacekjeznach.com/)

Should my intro section fade in one by one if I have time to implement this?

Evenly space menu bar

#### About

Photo of me?

Bigger icons with larger screen size, more icons per row with larger screen size

Why did I want 4 social media buttons?

#### Blog

Fix HTML formatting for tabbing in/readability on this page. Prettier might catch it but I haven't noticed it reformatting anything

#### Blog Post

This could potentially be a bit more interesting and feature some more responsive design

#### Projects

Fix HTML formatting for tabbing in/readability on this page. Prettier might catch it but I haven't noticed it reformatting anything

#### Contact

Message on Twitter, email and LinkedIn?

For the email link, I might just add my email address rather than mailto. Every time I've come across a mailto it's tried to set up a mail client I don't use.

Change submit button to whoosh? - Would this clash with the style and tone of the rest of my portfolio?

Form fields:
- First Name
- Last Name
- email address
- Message

#### Projects

Same layout as blog page. External links or links to separate pages? Can be resolved later

### Presentation

Considered agile methodology when it came to Trello, however I decided user stories would be fairly difficult due to having to meet quite specific requirements for the assignment. With that said, concepts such as design sprints occured through the nature of the soft deadlines provided by Andrew and Cat.
